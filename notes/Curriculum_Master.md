# AI Curriculum — 3-Month Accelerated Program (Option A)

This document outlines the full accelerated 3-month AI Engineering curriculum designed to teach practical AI development, LLM usage, tool integration, automation, and portfolio project building.

---

# 🎯 GOALS
By the end of this curriculum you will be able to:

- Understand how modern LLMs work (in a conceptual, engineering-relevant way)
- Prompt models effectively using reusable pattern frameworks
- Build AI-assisted apps using JavaScript/Node and Python
- Use Cursor for “vibe coding” and AI-assisted development
- Work confidently with GitHub (branches, commits, PRs, projects)
- Build automations with n8n
- Build Slack/Teams assistants with APIs + webhooks
- Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- Deploy full applications (Vercel, Fly.io, or simple cloud hosting)
- Produce a professional-grade portfolio with 3–5 real projects
