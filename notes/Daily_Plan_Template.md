# Example Daily Plan

## 1. Understand  
Today I will watch the Karpathy “State of GPT” video and begin capturing foundational mental models.

## 2. Analyze  
Break steps into:
- Watch video  
- Capture notes  
- Add to GitHub repo  
- Commit/push  

## 3. Reason  
This builds baseline intuition for LLM capabilities and informs future prompt design.

## 4. Synthesize  
### Goals:
1. Add notes to `karpathy-state-of-gpt.md`  
2. Commit to GitHub  
3. Review prompting patterns  

Commit message:
`Add initial Karpathy notes`

## 5. Conclude  
Summarize what was learned and identify questions for tomorrow.
