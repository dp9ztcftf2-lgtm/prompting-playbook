# Prompting Playbook

> **Note:** This project is currently in a planning/scaffolding phase. Not all components described in this README exist yet. The README outlines the intended direction, architecture, and goals for this repository.

A curated collection of notes, templates, and best practices for learning AI prompting, LLM reasoning patterns, and real-world AI engineering workflows.

This playbook tracks my progress through a structured AI Engineering curriculum focused on:
- LLM fundamentals  
- Prompt design  
- Function calling and structured outputs  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- AI-assisted development  
- Automations and agents  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as both:
1. **A learning journal** documenting concepts, patterns, and insights.  
2. **A reference resource** for future projects involving AI apps, automations, and tools.
